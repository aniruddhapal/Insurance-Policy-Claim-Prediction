Our goal is to predict a binary target variable based on various features in the provided training and test datasets. The dataset presents challenges such as missing values and varying distributions, which necessitate careful preprocessing to optimize model performance.\n","\n","## Why This Project\n","\n","Binary classification is a common machine learning task with applications in finance, healthcare, and customer analysis. This project provides an opportunity to apply data preprocessing techniques and deep learning models to achieve high accuracy in a competitive setting. It serves as a valuable exercise to enhance skills in handling missing data, feature scaling, and constructing effective neural network architectures.\n","\n","## Goal\n","\n","Our primary goal is to develop a predictive model that classifies the target variable 'claim' into binary classes (0 or 1) based on the provided features. We aim to optimize the model using data preprocessing, feature scaling, and deep learning techniques, and then evaluate its performance on the test set by submitting predictions.\n","\n","## Strategy Used to Solve the Problem\n","\n","1. **Data Preprocessing**:\n","   - **Handling Missing Values**: Utilizes `SimpleImputer` with a median strategy to address missing values.\n","   - **Feature Scaling**: Applies `QuantileTransformer` and `KBinsDiscretizer` to transform features into a uniform distribution and discretize them for improved model training.\n","\n","2. **Model Architecture**:\n","   - **Neural Network Model**: Constructs a Sequential model with an embedding layer, dense layers, and dropout layers to prevent overfitting.\n","   - **Optimizer and Learning Rate Scheduling**: Employs `RMSprop` optimizer with a learning rate schedule to dynamically adjust the learning rate during training.\n","   - **Evaluation Metric**: Uses AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) to measure the model's performance.\n","\n","3. **Training and Prediction**:\n","   - **Model Training**: Trains the model on the preprocessed training data with a batch size of 1024 and for 100 epochs.\n","   - **Making Predictions**: Uses the trained model to predict the target variable for the test dataset and saves the results in a submission file.\n","\n","## How the Goal is Achieved\n","\n","1. **Data Preparation**: Loads and preprocesses the datasets by filling missing values and applying feature scaling transformations to prepare the data for model training.\n","\n","2. **Model Building**: Constructs and compiles a neural network using TensorFlow and Keras, including an embedding layer for feature representation and dense layers for classification, with dropout layers to reduce overfitting.\n","\n","3. **Training and Evaluation**: Compiles the model with binary cross-entropy loss and AUC as the metric, trains it on the training data, and makes predictions on the test data.\n","\n","4. **Submission**: Saves the final predictions in a CSV file for submission to the competition.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"897d43a8","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-08-27T14:26:17.437846Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-08-27T14:26:17.43713Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-08-27T14:26:22.75419Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-08-27T14:26:22.754673Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-29T06:04:11.81012Z"},"papermill":{"duration":5.428164,"end_time":"2024-08-27T14:26:22.754995","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-08-27T14:26:17.326831","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["import
